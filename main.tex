\chapter*{Abstract}
In this report the students developed an approach for solving mathematical problems related to engineering by the help of deep learning. The goal is to extract boundary conditions and trigger words that determine type of word problems. The difficulty consists in finding an appropriate software library which can handle input of mathematical expressions within normal text. After a discovery phase we chose spaCy and its builtin NER system for information extraction. Owing the small amount of data a preprocessing is done, which provides a stronger bias. However, our results are a good demonstration what state-of-the-art CNN in the field of NLP is capable of achieving and are comparable to other research work that have been done.
