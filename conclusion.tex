Based on current research, we present an approach to formulating mathematical equation from a mathematical problem. We used a combination of regex and deep learning to extract boundary conditions and trigger words that determine type of word problems. With the help of customizable NER model of spaCy which is powered by deep learning algorithm \textbf{\textit{encode, embed, attend, predict}}, we were able to label and use the labelled data as input for reformulating.
\par This NER model can be scaled to determine the given conditions or values or inequalities of problems within a narrow scope, with each new data introduced to the model needs to be trained to be able to learn and predict on a test data. In that regard, our model is merely of a demonstration of methods and does not identify the whole attributes of the given problems due to the invariance between the problems and the limited data which was available.
\par For future work if the text structure is limited to a minimum and also consider the types of problems a more stable problem formulating model can be built with deep learning.
